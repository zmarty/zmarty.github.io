## About Me

Hi! My name is Ovi, and I love technology.

I left Romania after high school and completed my undergraduate studies in Amsterdam, with a detour in Hong Kong. I then moved to the US East Coast to pursue a PhD. Early in my career, I co-founded three startups and successfully sold a couple of them.

I later relocated to the Pacific Northwest (Seattle area) where I worked at Microsoft for 12 years, primarily in online services with a focus on Bing. The last project I worked on there was Copilot.

Currently, I work for Visa, where I lead the 200+ developers at [Authorize.Net](https://www.authorize.net), processing more than $200 billion in transactions every year.

In my free time, I enjoy writing code and tinkering with AI.
